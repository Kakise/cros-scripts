# cros-scripts
A collection of scripts used to setup my Chrome OS dev environement 

Perfectly working on Neverware Cloudready Home Edition.

After running this script, you will have an executable home directory, and you'll be able to start a docker container containing clang using 
```docker start -ia clang```

You need to disable rootfs verification and reboot before using this script !
